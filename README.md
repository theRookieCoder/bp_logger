# Distribution
This app is being distributed using Progressive Web Apps.
The app should be accessible using any modern browser by going [here](bp-logger-rookie-coder.web.app) or [here](bp-logger-rookie-coder.firebaseapp.com) (websites hosted by Firebase Hosting)  
Then the website can be added to the homescreen which makes the app work just like a native iOS/Android app.  
This app performs best on high and mid range phones. Low tier phones may struggle but app functionality is not impacted much.
