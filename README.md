# BP Logger

## What is it
BP Logger is a Flutter app that allows you to keep track of your BP by logging it in a file in Google Drive.  
To use BP Logger, you must first sign in with Google. Then BP Logger will use your Google account to access your Google Drive (with your permission).  
After that, BP Logger can add the date, time, diastolic, and systolic values to a GSheets file called log.  

# Distribution
This app is being distributed using Progressive Web Apps and APK releases here.  
The app should be accessible using any modern browser by going [here](https://bp-logger-rookie-coder.web.app/) or [here](https://bp-logger-rookie-coder.firebaseapp.com/) (websites hosted by Firebase Hosting)  
You can also download an APK release from Github releases and install it on your phone. This native build performs better and launches _much_ faster than web.  
Then the website can also be added to the homescreen which makes the app work similarly to a native iOS/Android app.
