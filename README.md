# BP Logger

## What is it

BP Logger is a Flutter app that allows you to keep track of your BP by logging it in a file in Google Drive.  
To use BP Logger, you must first sign in with Google. Then BP Logger will use your Google account to access your Google Drive (with your permission).  
After that, BP Logger can add the date, time, diastolic, and systolic values to a GSheets file called log.

## Distribution

This app is being distributed using IPAs for sideloading via AltStore and APKs for Android. These can be downloaded in Github releases  
Alternatively, the app should be accessible using any modern browser by going [here](https://bp-logger-rookie-coder.web.app/) or [here](https://bp-logger-rookie-coder.firebaseapp.com/) (websites hosted by Firebase Hosting)  
The website can also be added to the homescreen which makes the app work similarly to a native iOS/Android app with much worse perfromance and loading times.

Beta: You can also use <a href="itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=https://therookiecoder.github.io/bp_logger/bp_logger.plist">this link</a> to install the app OTA
