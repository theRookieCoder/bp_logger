    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Why do I need to sign in to Google?</h3>
    <p>
      BP Logger stores your information in a spreadsheet in your Google Drive so
      that you can access your information quickly and easily from anywhere.
      Hence, the app needs access to your Google Drive to write to the
      spreadsheet.
    </p>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>How do I export my BP values?</h3>
    <p>
      You do not have to 'export' your BP values because the spreadsheet that
      your BP values are written to is accessible to you. Simply open Google
      Drive, open the folder called BP Logger, and there should be a spreadsheet
      there called <code>log</code>. This file contains the date, time,
      diastolic, and systolic values.
    </p>
    <h3>Will there be statistics?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, there is no statistics in the app. This feature is on my
      roadmap however so I might introduce it later.
